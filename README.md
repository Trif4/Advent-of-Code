# Advent of Code
Christmassy puzzle fun! I enjoy playing around with language features and improving familiarity with the standard
library while solving these, so some solutions may be slightly less readable but 40% fancier. I find it to be a good
way to improve general language proficiency without turning production code into a playground.

As life tends to get busy when Christmas draws near, I have yet to actually complete a full year. Maybe someday!
